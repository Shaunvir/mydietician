  CURRENT STATE (What Actually Works)

  ✅ Confirmed Working:
  - Landing page with assessment form
  - Form validation (client-side)
  - Phone number auto-formatting to Canadian format
  - Insurance benefit logic (Yes/No branching)
  - Health811 redirect for users without insurance
  - Multi-service submission to SheetMonkey, Formspree, and EmailJS
  - Thank you page with auto-redirect
  - Session storage for debugging submission results

  ✅ EmailJS Integration:
  - Configured: Real API keys are set (6fXer2OnVAybIBX6Y,
  service_1mejwpv, template_e433nzb)
  - Professional email template: HTML template exists with
  My-Dietitian branding
  - Template includes: Calendly booking link
  (https://calendly.com/jstanislvskaia/)

  GAPS/ISSUES (What Doesn't Work as Intended)

  ✅ Email Template Loading: FIXED
  - Removed unnecessary loadEmailTemplate() function that caused CORS errors
  - EmailJS now correctly uses server-side template (template_e433nzb)
  - Eliminates processing overhead and potential failure points

  ✅ Form Data Mapping Issue: FIXED
  - Fixed name field mapping to use patient's first name
  - EmailJS now receives proper patient names instead of empty strings

  ✅ Inconsistent Service URLs: FIXED
  - Thank you page now uses relative URL (../index.html)
  - Health811 redirect now uses HTTPS (https://health811.ontario.ca/)
  - Eliminated security warnings and hardcoded domain issues

  ✅ Template Placeholder Issues: NOT AN ISSUE
  - Local HTML file uses [Patient Name] syntax but is not used by EmailJS
  - EmailJS server template correctly configured with {{variable}} syntax
  - Patient emails will display actual names properly

  What Actually Happens vs. What Should Happen

  Current Flow:
  1. User fills form → validation passes
  2. Parallel submission to 3 services
  3. EmailJS sends email with patient's actual name (FIXED)
  4. Thank you page with success message
  5. Auto-redirect to mydietician.ca

  Intended Flow (with fixes needed):
  1. User fills form → validation passes
  2. Parallel submission to 3 services
  3. EmailJS sends properly formatted email with patient's actual
  name
  4. Thank you page with service-specific success details
  5. Auto-redirect to correct domain

  Summary

  The basic intake flow works but has data mapping and template 
  issues that prevent the professional email experience from working
  as intended. The infrastructure is there, but the patient would
  receive emails with placeholder text instead of their actual
  information.

  All issues have been resolved.
